# Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA

This project demonstrates how to implement the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model for time series forecasting. The code trains an ARIMA model on a synthetic time series dataset, forecasts future values, and visualizes both the forecasted and historical data.

## Overview
The ARIMA model is widely used for time series forecasting and can handle various types of time series data. This project covers:
- Generating synthetic time series data.
- Checking and ensuring the data is stationary.
- Applying the ARIMA model to forecast future values.
- Visualizing the forecasted values alongside the historical data.

## Concepts

### ARIMA Model
ARIMA stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average:
- **AutoRegressive (AR) Part**: Uses the dependency between an observation and a number of lagged observations.
- **Integrated (I) Part**: Involves differencing the raw observations to make the series stationary.
- **Moving Average (MA) Part**: Uses the dependency between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations.

### Stationarity
A stationary time series has constant statistical properties (mean, variance) over time. ARIMA models assume that the data is stationary, and if it is not, differencing is used to achieve stationarity.

### Forecasting
ARIMA models forecast future values based on past observations. The model provides predictions along with confidence intervals to account for uncertainty in the forecasts.

## Variables and Parameters

### Dataset
- **`time_series_data`**: The input time series data used for training the ARIMA model. In this project, synthetic data is generated, but you can replace it with real-world time series data.

### Model Parameters
- **`arima_order`**: The order of the ARIMA model specified as `(p, d, q)`:
  - `p` = Number of AR terms
  - `d` = Number of differences to make the series stationary
  - `q` = Number of MA terms

### Forecasting
- **`forecast_steps`**: Number of future time periods to forecast.

### Confidence Intervals
- **`confidence_intervals`**: The range of uncertainty for the forecasted values.

## Prerequisites
Make sure to install the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `statsmodels`

You can install them using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib statsmodels
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/time-series-forecasting-arima.git
   cd time-series-forecasting-arima
   ```

2. **Run the Script**:
   To execute the ARIMA forecasting and visualization, run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python arima_forecasting.py
   ```

3. **Modify Parameters**:
   Adjust the dataset, ARIMA model order `(p, d, q)`, and `forecast_steps` in the script as needed.

## Visualization

### 1. **Historical Data and Forecasted Values**
The plot displays the historical time series data and the forecasted values. The forecasted values are shown in red, with confidence intervals represented by a shaded region.

## Applications

ARIMA models have a wide range of applications in various fields:

1. **Stock Market Forecasting**: Predicting future stock prices and market trends.
2. **Weather Prediction**: Forecasting weather conditions like temperature and precipitation.
3. **Demand Forecasting**: Estimating future product demand for supply chain and inventory management.
4. **Energy Consumption**: Predicting future energy usage for optimizing distribution and resource allocation.
